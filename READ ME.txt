I wrote this code in Python 3.10.6 in VSCode with a Jupyter notebooks layout.

packages are:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib.pyplot
seaborn
sys (although you probably don't need it unless you want to widen the let_me_take_the_wheel() printouts)


There are two dependent txt files for the two tracks that I will include in my submission

Two classes Track and Car

4 cars per track = 8 cars total

With the currently saved configurations in the file, the cars all take >5 minutes to run, some nearly 10 minutes. 
if you want to test the human driving version, it's  .let_me_take_the_wheel(l_track.assign_starting_point(), l_track)
